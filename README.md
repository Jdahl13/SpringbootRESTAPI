# SpringbootRESTAPI
REST API practice with Java and Springboot

Since it has been years since I was regularly coding in school, I am trying to give myself a refresher. I am following a tutorial on REST API with Springboot and Java. It can be found at: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/easiest-way-to-create-rest-api-using-spring-boot/

To help myself understand, I will be modifying info in the tutorial with the goal of not just following it line by line.
