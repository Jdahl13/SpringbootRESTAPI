# SpringbootRESTAPI
REST API practice with Java and Springboot

Since it has been years since I was regularly coding in school, I am trying to give myself a refresher. I am following a tutorial on REST API with Springboot and Java. It can be found at: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/easiest-way-to-create-rest-api-using-spring-boot/

To help myself understand, I will be modifying info in the tutorial with the goal of not just following it line by line. To ensure full understanding I will be commenting the heck out of this code as well as updating progress on this readme. 

Updates:
First task was getting dev environment ready, needed to reinstall IntelliJ and get mySQL up and running. This proved to be a "Friendly" reminder on how long these tasks can take. Ended up setting up a PATH variable in my .bash_profile file to allow me to run mysql from the command line anywhere instead of traversing directories to find the install location and setting up a temporary path export.  After numerous trial and error I was able to get it up and running successfully.

Next was setting up various classes, and controllers. I followed the tutorial to the T for now, but will be modifying and extending for different tasks.
